# Interactivity is great


Loading the tidyverse
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

Loading the AirBNB dataseet.
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    rating = review_scores_location / 2
  ) |> 
  select(
    neighbourhood, neighbourhood_group, rating, price, room_type, lat, long
  ) |> 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price <= 500,
    price >= 100
  )
```

Let's make a scatterplot but an interactive one
```{r} 
nyc_airbnb |>  #learning plotly code
  mutate(
    label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)
  ) |> 
  plot_ly( 
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price,
    text = ~label,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5 #alpha makes color gradient
  )
```
