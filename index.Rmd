Can still do all usual things in RMD.

Can add text.

This website is an example from [P8105](https://p8105.com/making_websites.html), we're making websites today.

Learn more about this site [here](about.html)

I also use [google a lot](https://www.google.com/) for completing data science tasks.

To show that you can just use RMD like normal, check out [this page](plots.html) with plots

You can also embed images, here's a picture of Mister Seal!
